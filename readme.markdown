# stream adventure (fr)

**This is a temporary FR fork of `stream-adventure`, until the original one is globalizable (g11n) in-place, at which point the FR L10n will be merged in and this repo removed.**

Go on an educational stream adventure!

# install

First install [node](http://nodejs.org) version 0.10 or later.

Once you've installed `node`, you will have an `npm` command.

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install -g stream-adventure-fr
```

If you want to play offline, make a new directory then do:

```
npm install through concat-stream duplexer trumpet request split tar \
    websocket-stream stream-combiner
```

# run

Now just type `stream-adventure` to play!
